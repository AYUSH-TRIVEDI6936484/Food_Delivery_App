# Food Delivery Website using MERN Stack

## Introduction

This project is a comprehensive guide on creating a food delivery website using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The MERN stack is a powerful combination of technologies that enables the development of scalable and efficient web applications. This project specifically focuses on building a user-friendly and responsive food delivery website, incorporating modern design principles and best practices.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database for storing and managing data.
- **Express.js:** A web application framework for building robust and scalable backend APIs.
- **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **Node.js:** A server-side JavaScript runtime for running server-side applications.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/food-delivery.git
   cd food-delivery
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   # Install server dependencies
   cd server
   npm install

   # Install client dependencies
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure MongoDB:**
   - Set up a MongoDB database and obtain the connection string.
   - Update the `server/config/config.js` file with your MongoDB connection string.

4. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   # Run the server
   cd server
   npm start

   # Run the client
   cd ../client
   npm start
   ```

   Access the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Features

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Implement user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user login and registration.

2. **Restaurant Listings:**
   - Display a list of restaurants with details such as name, cuisine, and ratings.

3. **Menu and Ordering:**
   - Provide a user-friendly interface for browsing restaurant menus and placing orders.
